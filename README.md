# Welcome to Cosmos Component For React

Cosmos Component UI is a simplified react component for building clean MVP rapidly.

[Visit our hosted storybook :)](https://cosmos-cmp-ui.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-article--aritcle-view-ui)

## Purpose
For the number of MVP products I create, having a component library benefits me tremendously.

Instead of copying from a previous project template, this component library hosted on NPM is the best thing I have created to simplify my work.

This component library is so easy to use compared to some of the components of the big name. My component library is like the skeleton for a project where you can add your custom CSS for whatever you want.
