# Welcome to Cosmos React UI CMP (Component)

Cosmos React UI Component is new to us and we are looking to add more improvements and test code for stable releases.

## What is the purpose for this Component Library?

As a consultant we have code repetition through out our different projects
and we wanted to be able to pull code component without reusing our code template over and over.
We want to have a simple React Template but with the flexibility to do an NPM install on our own UI component.

## Objectives

The components are simplified to the extend where you as the developer don't need to read materials to understand how it works.
This assumes that you are already familiar with React. But if you are not familiar with React, then please look at our story book examples that has snippet code for you to use directly in your projects.
